# This is a Python comment in my first Python app.

# This is how to create a variable in Python
variablename = value

# This won't work:
value = variablename

# This variable contains an integer
quantity = 14

# This variable contains a float
unit_price = 26.99

# This variable contains the result of multiplying quantity times unit price
extended_price = quantity * unit_price

# Show the results
print(extended_price)

# This is acceptable:
first_name = "Alan"
last_name = "Simpson"
print(first_name, last_name)

# And so is this:
first_name = "Alan"; last_name = "Simpson"
print(first_name, last_name)
